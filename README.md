## "I am an athlete"
Arriving at this place of reality has been a long, slow journey; filled with loads of mistakes and misconceptions. However, this is less of an arrival, and more like a new starting line. To make noticeable gains, it'll require discipline in my habits: eating, sleeping, and drinking water. Over the course of time, I have chosen three methods of exercise by which I will maintain my body and the level of athleticism I choose to enjoy: Running, Weightlifting, and HIIT Bodyweight Exercise. 


### Running
Running is my cardio of choice. I enjoy running – the long, slow, meditative run. I run to remember. I run to forget. I run simply to enjoy my thoughts and they come and go. 
Goals:


### Weightlifting
I am a natural bodybuilder. I do not and will not, take any drugs to enhance my body. I choose not to use wrist straps or weight belts to aid my lifts. If I can't lift it naturally, I will train until I can.
Method: Periodization.
Goals:


### HIIT Bodyweight Exercise
My method of choice is using an App called Freeletics. I've been a subscriber for a few years now, and have found the Coach plan to work well with adapting the feedback I give – providing me with an always-evolving program that meets my need for volume and intensity.
